    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>This healthy taco salad is one of my favorite meals 
    to throw together when I’m trying to make carb-conscious 
    choices without sacrificing flavor. the key to this high-protein,
    low-carb salad is to make a few smart swaps: just brown some seasoned
    ground turkey instead of the usual ground beef, substitute air-fried
    tortilla strips in place of store-bought strips, then pile on the
    fresh veggies. the best part of this salad is the homemade creamy 
    cilantro dressing, blended with avocado, jalapeño, and garlic; 
    trust me, even cilantro-haters will love it.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> making the dressing by adding cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, 
            mayo, sour cream, 
            and the juice of one lime to a food processor. 
            season with salt and pepper, then blend mixture until
             smooth. if desired, add another splash of water to 
             thin mixture, or add more mayonnaise to thicken. 
             refrigerate dressing until the salad is ready to 
             serve.</li>
        <li>in a large skillet over medium heat, add a spritz of oil 
            and begin browning the turkey, breaking it up with a
             spatula as it cooks. stir in the taco seasoning and 
             continue heating until cooked through. set aside.</li>
        <li>cut tortillas into strips and toss with avocado oil, then 
            sprinkle with coarse salt. spread evenly in the basket of 
            an air fryer, then heat at 325°F for 3-4 minutes. shake the 
            basket a few times to ensure the strips cook evenly, then 
            return to the air fryer for another 2-3 minutes, or until 
            crispy.</li>
        <li>in a large shallow bowl, make a bed of lettuce and begin
             assembling the salad. add ground turkey, corn, beans, 
             tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, avocado, and crispy tortilla 
             strips. drizzle with creamy cilantro dressing and top with
              a sprinkle of cotija cheese. toss it all together and
             garnish with lime wedges.
        </li>
